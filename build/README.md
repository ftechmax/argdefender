**Running the Build Scripts**

You need PowerShell or PowerShell Core.

* Windows: You already have `powershell`.
* Linux: See [Installing PowerShell Core on Linux][1] on Microsoft Docs for `pwsh`.
* macOS: Run `brew cask install powershell` for `pwsh`.

**Install the .NET Core CLI** - `install-dotnet.ps1`

Downloads portable .NET Core SDKs 2.1.400 and 1.1.9 to the "artifacts/dotnet". Skips the download if
these versions already exist in the folder.

**Build the Library** - `build.ps1`

Builds the project into "artifacts/build".

* `-NoInstall`: If set, the build script won't call `install-dotnet.ps1`.  
* `-Configuration`: "Debug" or "Release". The default is "Release".  
* `-Framework`: "netstandard2.0" or "netstandard1.0". The default is "netstandard2.0".

**Run the Unit Tests** - `test.ps1`

Builds the project in place and runs the unit tests. Optionally, collects test coverage using the
awesome [coverlet][2].

* `-NoInstall`: If set, the test script won't call `install-dotnet.ps1`.
* `-Configuration`: "Debug" or "Release". The default is "Release".
* `-Logger`: Specifies a logger for test results.
* `-Coverage`: If set, produces test coverage.
* `-CoverageFormat`: Output format of the coverage results. The default is "opencover".
* `-CoverageOutput`: The output path of the coverage results. The default is "artifacts/coverage.xml".

**Create Snippets** - `snippets.ps1`

Creates code snippets for Visual Studio in "snippets".

* `-NoInstall`: If set, the snippets script won't call `install-dotnet.ps1`.

**Use Your Existing .NET Core CLI**

The build and test scripts assume that `dotnet` is in PATH when `-NoInstall` is set and the SDKs
are not found in the "artifacts/dotnet".
